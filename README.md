Business Insights 360
Project Overview

The Business Insights 360 Project stands as a comprehensive data visualization initiative developed using Power BI. Its purpose is to deliver real-time, tailored insights to stakeholders, catering to their specific needs. The project encompasses five primary views: Finance, Sales, Marketing, Supply Chain, and Executive, each highlighting key metrics and KPIs to facilitate data-driven decision-making.
Problem Statement
